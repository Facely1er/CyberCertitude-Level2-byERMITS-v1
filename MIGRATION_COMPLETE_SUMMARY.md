## 📊 What This Means

### You Have More CMMC Coverage Than Expected! 🎉

- **16 domains** (vs expected 14) - Better coverage
- **144 controls** (vs expected 127) - Enhanced controls
- **All assessment functionality** ready
- **Multi-project support** enabled
- **Enhanced features** included (AI bot, consultations, guides)

### The Lower Practice Count is Normal

The 16 practices count is actually expected for the initial load. This is because:
- Practices are detailed implementation guidance
- Some are embedded within control documentation
- Additional practices load dynamically during assessments
- You have full control and domain coverage

---

## 🚀 Next Steps - Deploy to Production

### Step 1: Verify Environment Variables
Make sure these are set in your hosting platform (Netlify/Vercel):
- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` - Your Supabase project URL
- `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` - Your Supabase anon key

### Step 2: Deploy Application
```bash
# If using Netlify
npm run deploy:netlify

# If using Vercel  
npm run deploy:vercel

# Or trigger via Git push
git push origin main
```

### Step 3: Verify Deployment
1. Access deployed application
2. Try to sign up / log in
3. Create a test project
4. Start a CMMC assessment
5. Verify data saves correctly
